# What I Often Find Missing in Designs

<div class="relative">
  <div v-click-hide>
  <v-clicks>

  - Named components (and named frames and grouped layers)
  - Pre-defined layouts
  - Variants and different states for components
  - Unhappy path
  - Annotation of interactions
  - One sheet for icons, logos, and components
  - Consistency for colors, font sizes, and spacings (and plenty of each)
  - Clean SVGs and other assets
  - Clear versioning

  </v-clicks>
  </div>

  <p v-after class="absolute top-0 mt-12">Mostly, a <em>design system</em>.</p>
</div>

<!-- Rectangle, group 121, table cel 11 -->
